# CRE Console Setup Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start

Your CRE Console application is ready! Here's how to get it running:

### 1. Development Server
```bash
cd cre-console
npm run dev
```
Visit: http://localhost:3000 (or 3004 if 3000 is in use)

### 2. Database Setup (Required for Full Functionality)

1. **Create Supabase Project**
   - Go to https://supabase.com
   - Create a new project
   - Note your project URL and anon key

2. **Run Database Schema**
   - Open your Supabase project dashboard
   - Go to SQL Editor
   - Copy and paste the entire contents of `supabase-schema.sql`
   - Click "Run" to create all tables, functions, and policies

3. **Configure Environment**
   - Update `.env.local` with your Supabase credentials:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
   ```

### 3. Cloudflare Pages Deployment

**Note**: There's currently a version conflict with @cloudflare/next-on-pages and Next.js 15.5.4. 

**Alternative deployment options:**
1. **Vercel** (Recommended): Deploy directly from GitHub
2. **Netlify**: Use Next.js static export
3. **Wait for Cloudflare compatibility**: Monitor @cloudflare/next-on-pages updates

For Vercel deployment:
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel
```
